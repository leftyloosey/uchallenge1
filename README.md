# Module 1 Challenge

## Welcome
This is my first attempt at the first module challenge of the UofU Coding Bootcamp. The task is to refactor for better accessibility the index.html and style.css files that constitute the landing page of an imaginary company providing SEO services called _Horiseon_.

I've fixed a broken link or two, filled in missing quotes, consolidated selectors in the stylesheet, and added some comments to explain some of the code and my changes to it.

Also, a snafu (one I caused) in my git repository has made it necessary for me to restart the whole project in a new repo. I lost many of my commit messages.
